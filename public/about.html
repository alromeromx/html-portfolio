<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Freelance Translator from Mexico, but I also love to program and develop websites.</p>

<p>My hobbies are:
<ul>
  <li>Music. I play guitar and piano.</li>
  <li>Videogames. I like playing PC games and Nintendo Switch games.</li>  
  <li>Motorcycles. I recently bought a Scooter to learn how to ride a motorcycle, but I'm planning to buy a chopper-style bike.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I hope you like my website. If you need a web developer, don't hesitate to ask me!</p>
